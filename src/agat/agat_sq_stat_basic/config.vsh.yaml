          Input GTF/GFF file.
        type: file
        required: true
        multiple: true
        direction: input

        alternatives: [-g]
        description: |
          That input is designed to know the genome size in order to calculate the percentage of the genome represented by each kind of feature type. You can provide an INTEGER. Or you can also pass a fasta file using the argument --genome_size_fasta. If both are provided, only the value of --genome_size will be considered.
        type: integer
        required: false
        example: 10000
      - name: --genome_size_fasta
        description: |
          That input is designed to know the genome size in order to calculate the percentage of the genome represented by each kind of feature type. You can provide the genome in fasta format. Or you can also pass the size directly as an integer using the argument --genome_size. If you provide the fasta, the genome size will be calculated on the fly. If both are provided, only the value of --genome_size will be considered.

          Output file. If no output file is specified, the output will be written to STDOUT. The result is in tabulate format.
        type: file
        direction: output
        required: true
        example: output.txt
  - name: Arguments
    arguments:
      - name: --inflate
        description: |
            Inflate the statistics taking into account feature with
            multi-parents. Indeed to avoid redundant information, some gff
            factorize identical features. e.g: one exon used in two
            different isoform will be defined only once, and will have
            multiple parent. By default the script count such feature only
            once. Using the inflate option allows to count the feature and
            its size as many time there are parents.

            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
