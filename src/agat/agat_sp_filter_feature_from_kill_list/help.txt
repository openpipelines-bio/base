Name:
    agat_sp_filter_feature_from_kill_list.pl

Description:
    The script aims to remove features based on a kill list. The default
    behaviour is to look at the features's ID. If the feature has an ID
    (case insensitive) listed among the kill list it will be removed. /!\
    Removing a level1 or level2 feature will automatically remove all linked
    subfeatures, and removing all children of a feature will automatically
    remove this feature too.

Usage:
        agat_sp_filter_feature_from_kill_list.pl --gff infile.gff --kill_list file.txt  [ --output outfile ]
        agat_sp_filter_feature_from_kill_list.pl --help

Options:
    -f, --reffile, --gff or -ref
            Input GFF3 file that will be read

    -p, --type or -l
            primary tag option, case insensitive, list. Allow to specied the
            feature types that will be handled. You can specified a specific
            feature by given its primary tag name (column 3) as: cds, Gene,
            MrNa You can specify directly all the feature of a particular
            level: level2=mRNA,ncRNA,tRNA,etc level3=CDS,exon,UTR,etc By
            default all feature are taking into account. fill the option by
            the value "all" will have the same behaviour.

    --kl or --kill_list
            Kill list. One value per line.

    -a or --attribute
            Attribute tag to specify the attribute to analyse. Case
            sensitive. Default: ID

    -o or --output
            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified, the output will
            be written to STDOUT.

    -v      Verbose option for debugging purpose.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -h or --help
