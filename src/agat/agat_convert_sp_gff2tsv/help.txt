Name:
    agat_convert_sp_gff2tsv.pl

Description:
    The script aims to convert gtf/gff file into tabulated file. Attribute's
    tags from the 9th column become column titles.

Usage:
        agat_convert_sp_gff2tsv.pl -gff file.gff [ -o outfile ]
        agat_convert_sp_gff2tsv.pl --help

Options:
    --gff or -f
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    -o , --output , --out or --outfile
            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified, the output will
            be written to STDOUT.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -h or --help
