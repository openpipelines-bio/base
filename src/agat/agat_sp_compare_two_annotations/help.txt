Name:
    agat_sp_compare_two_annotations.pl

Description:
    The script aims to compare two annotation of the same assembly. It
    provided information about split/fusion of genes between the two
    annotations. The most common cases are: 1 => 0 ( gene uniq to file1) 0
    => 1 ( gene uniq to file2) 1 => 1 ( 1 gene from file 1 overlaps only 1
    gene from file2) 1 => <many> ( 1 gene from file 1 overlaps <many> genes
    from file2) => split case (with file 1 as reference) <many> => 1 (
    <many> genes from file 1 overlap only 1 gene from file2) => fusion case
    (with file 1 as reference)

    Then you can get more complex cases: <many> => <many> (<many> genes from
    file 1 overlap <many> genes from file2)

    The script output a folder containing a report of number of different
    cases as well as a file per case type listing per line the gene
    feature's ID involved in each case.

Usage:
        agat_sp_compare_two_annotations.pl -gff1 infile.gff [ -o outfile ]
        agat_sp_compare_two_annotations.pl --help

Options:
    -gff1   Input GTF/GFF file1.

    -gff2   Input GTF/GFF file2.

    -o , --output or --out
            Output folder. It contains a report that resume the type and
            number of cases, as well as a file per case type containing one
            case per line with the list of gene feature's ID (or other type
            of feature level1) from file1 then file2 separated by a |.

    --debug or -d
            Debug option, make it easier to follow what is going on for
            debugging purpose.

    --verbose or -v
            Verbose option, make it easier to follow what is going on.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
