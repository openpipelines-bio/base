Name:
    agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl

Description:
    The tool compares the results from two BUSCO runs (genome and proteome
    mode) in order to pinpoint the differences. It compares the BUSCOs
    classification (complete,fragmented, duplicated) of the 1st run (genome
    mode) against the classification found in the second run. It will report
    the results in txt files, and extracts the complete,fragmented and
    duplicated annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run in gff files. We add in the
    gff an attribute specifying the cases e.g.
    description=EOG090W00UK-complete2duplicated. Where EOG090W00UK is the
    BUSCO name/label/group investigated, and complete2duplicated the case we
    found (was complete in run1 and duplicated in run2). By loading these
    gff tracks in a web browser and helped by other tracks (e.g the genome
    annotation/prediction) can help to understand why the BUSCO have been
    classified differently from run1 to run2. In other term it allows to
    catch potential problems in an annotation. agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl
    has been tested with results from BUSCO version 3 and 4. /!\ The tool
    expects a BUSCO run in genome mode as input folder 1 and a BUSCO run in
    proteins mode as input folder 2. You can also decide to provide twice
    (--f1 --f2) the same BUSCO run in genome mode, the tool will only
    extract the annotation of the complete,fragmented and duplicated
    annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run in gff.

Usage:
        agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl --f1 <input busco folder1> --f2 <input busco folder2> [-o <output folder>]
        agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl --help

Options:
    --f1    STRING: Input busco folder1

    --f2    STRING: Input busco folder2

    -v or --verbose
            Integer: For displaying extra information use -v 1.

    -o or --output
            STRING: Output folder.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
