description: |
  The tool compares the results from two BUSCO runs (genome and proteome
  mode) in order to pinpoint the differences. It compares the BUSCOs
  classification (complete,fragmented, duplicated) of the 1st run (genome
  mode) against the classification found in the second run. It will report
  the results in txt files, and extracts the complete,fragmented and
  duplicated annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run in gff files. We add in the
  gff an attribute specifying the cases e.g.
  description=EOG090W00UK-complete2duplicated. Where EOG090W00UK is the
  BUSCO name/label/group investigated, and complete2duplicated the case we
  found (was complete in run1 and duplicated in run2). By loading these
  gff tracks in a web browser and helped by other tracks (e.g the genome
  annotation/prediction) can help to understand why the BUSCO have been
  classified differently from run1 to run2. In other term it allows to
  catch potential problems in an annotation. agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl
  has been tested with results from BUSCO version 3 and 4. /!\ The tool
  expects a BUSCO run in genome mode as input folder 1 and a BUSCO run in
  proteins mode as input folder 2. You can also decide to provide twice
  (--f1 --f2) the same BUSCO run in genome mode, the tool will only
  extract the annotation of the complete,fragmented and duplicated
  annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run in gff.

          Input AGAT config file. By default, AGAT takes as input `agat_config.yaml` file from the working directory if any, otherwise it takes the original `agat_config.yaml` shipped with AGAT. To get the `agat_config.yaml` locally type: `agat config --expose`. The `--config` option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).
