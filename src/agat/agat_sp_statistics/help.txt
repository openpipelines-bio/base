Name:
    agat_sp_statistics.pl

Description:
    The script provides exhaustive statistics of a gft/gff file. /!\ If you
    have isoforms in your file, even if correct, some values calculated
    might sounds incoherent: e.g. total length mRNA can be superior than the
    genome size. Because all isoforms length is added... It is why by
    default we always compute the statistics twice when there are isoforms,
    once with the isoforms, once without (In that case we keep the longest
    isoform per locus).

Usage:
        agat_sp_statistics.pl --gff file.gff  [ -o outfile ]
        agat_sp_statistics.pl --help

Options:
    --gff or -i
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    --gs, -f or -g
            This option inform about the genome size in oder to compute more
            statistics. You can give the size in Nucleotide or directly the
            fasta file.

    -d or -p
            When this option is used, an histogram of distribution of the
            features will be printed in pdf files. (d means distribution, p
            means plot).

    -v or --verbose
            Verbose option. To modify verbosity. Default is 1. 0 is quiet, 2
            and 3 are increasing verbosity.

    --output or -o
            File where will be written the result. If no output file is
            specified, the output will be written to STDOUT.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -h or --help
            Display this helpful text.
