Name:
    agat_sp_extract_attributes.pl

Description:
    The script takes a gtf/gff file as input. The script allows to extract
    choosen attributes of all or specific feature types. The 9th column of a
    gff/gtf file contains a list of attributes. An attribute (gff3) looks
    like that tag=value

Usage:
        agat_sp_extract_attributes.pl --gff file.gff  --att locus_tag,product,name -p level2,cds,exon [ -o outfile ]
        agat_sp_extract_attributes.pl --help

Options:
    --gff or -f
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    -p, -t or -l
            primary tag option, case insensitive, list. Allow to specied the
            feature types that will be handled. You can specified a specific
            feature by given its primary tag name (column 3) as: cds, Gene,
            MrNa You can specify directly all the feature of a particular
            level: level2=mRNA,ncRNA,tRNA,etc level3=CDS,exon,UTR,etc By
            default all feature are taking in account. fill the option by
            the value "all" will have the same behaviour.

    --attribute, --att, -a
            attribute tag. The value of the attribute tag specified will be
            extracted from the feature type specified by the option -p. List
            of attributes must be coma separated.

    --merge or -m
            By default the values of each attribute tag is writen in its
            dedicated file. To write the values of all tags in only one file
            use this option.

    -d      By default when an attribute is not found for a feature, a dot
            (.) is reported. If you don't want anything to be printed in
            such case use this option.

    -o , --output , --out or --outfile
            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified, the output will
            be written to STDOUT.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
