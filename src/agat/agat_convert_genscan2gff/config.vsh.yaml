namespace: agat
description: |
  The script takes a genscan file as input, and will translate it in gff
  format. The genscan format is described here:
  http://genome.crg.es/courses/Bioinformatics2003_genefinding/results/gens
  can.html /!\ vvv Known problem vvv /!\ You must have submited only DNA
  sequence, wihtout any header!! Indeed the tool expects only DNA
  sequences and does not crash/warn if an header is submited along the
  sequence. e.g If you have an header ">seq" s-e-q are seen as the 3 first
  nucleotides of the sequence. Then all prediction location are shifted
  accordingly. (checked only on the online version
  http://argonaute.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html. I don't know if there is the same
  problem elsewhere.) /!\ ^^^ Known problem ^^^^ /!\

          The source informs about the tool used to produce the data and is stored in 2nd field of a gff file. Example: Stringtie, Maker, Augustus, etc. [default: data]

      - name: --primary_tag
        description: |
          The primary_tag corresponds to the data type and is stored in 3rd field of a gff file. Example: gene, mRNA, CDS, etc. [default: gene]
        type: string
        required: false
        example: gene
      - name: --inflate_off
        description: |
          By default we inflate the block fields (blockCount, blockSizes, blockStarts) to create subfeatures of the main feature (primary_tag). Type of subfeature created based on the inflate_type parameter. If you don't want this inflating behaviour you can deactivate it by using the option --inflate_off.

          Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any, otherwise it takes the original agat_config.yaml shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).
