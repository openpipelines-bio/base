Name:
    agat_sp_add_introns.pl

Description:
    The script aims to add intron features to gtf/gff file without intron
    features.

Usage:
        agat_sp_add_introns.pl --gff infile --out outFile
        agat_sp_add_introns.pl --help

Options:
    --gff, -f, --ref or -reffile
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    --out, --output or -o
            Output GFF3 file.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    --help or -h
            Display this helpful text.
