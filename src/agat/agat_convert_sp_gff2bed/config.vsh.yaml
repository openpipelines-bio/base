description: |
  The script aims to convert GTF/GXF file into bed file. It will convert
  level2 features from gff (mRNA, transcripts) into bed features. If the
  selected level2 subfeatures (defaut: exon) exist, they are reported in
  the block fields (9-12th colum in bed). CDS Start and End are reported
  in column 7 and 8 accordingly.

  ### Definition of the bed format: 
  #### Definition of the BED format:
  1. **chrom** - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671).
  2. **chromStart** - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
  3. **chromEnd** - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.

  #### OPTIONAL fields:
  4. **name** - Defines the name of the BED line. This label is displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser window when the track is open to full display mode or directly to the left of the item in pack mode.
  5. **score** - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray).
  6. **strand** - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
  7. **thickStart** - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly.
  8. **thickEnd** - The ending position at which the feature is drawn thickly.
  9. **itemRgb** - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the track line itemRgb attribute is set to "On", this RGB value will determine the display color of the data contained in this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme (eight colors or less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming the color resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser.
  10. **blockCount** - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line.
  11. **blockSizes** - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
  12. **blockStarts** - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.

          Behaviour for non-coding features (e.g. records without CDS):

          * keep: Default, they are kept but no CDS position is reported in the 7th and 8th columns (a period is reported instead).  
          * filter: We remove them.  
          * transcript: We keep them but values in the 7th and 8th columns will contain transcript's start and stop.

          Input AGAT config file. By default, AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any, otherwise it takes the original agat_config.yaml shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: `agat config --expose`. The `--config` option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).
