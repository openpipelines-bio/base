Name:
    agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl

Description:
    This script merge different gff annotation files in one. It uses the
    AGAT parser that takes care of duplicated names and fixes other oddities
    met in those files.

Usage:
        agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl --gff infile1 --gff infile2 --out outFile
        agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl --help

Options:
    --gff or -f
            Input GTF/GFF file(s). You can specify as much file you want
            like so: -f file1 -f file2 -f file3

    --out, --output or -o
            Output gff3 file where the gene incriminated will be write.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    --help or -h
