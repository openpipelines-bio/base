Name:
    agat_sp_add_intergenic_regions.pl

Description:
    The script aims to add intergenic features (intergenic_region) to
    gtf/gff file. The intergenic regions are deduced from gene features
    (feature type gene from the 3rd column).

Usage:
        agat_sp_add_intergenic_regions.pl --gff infile --out outFile
        agat_sp_add_intergenic_regions.pl --help

Options:
    --gff, -f or --ref
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    --out, --output or -o
            Output file (default GFF3 - see config to modify output format).

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives yo the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -v or --verbose
            Add verbosity

    -h or --help
