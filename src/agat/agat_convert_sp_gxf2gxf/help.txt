Name:
    agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl

Description:
    This script fixes and/or standardizes any GTF/GFF file into full sorted
    GTF/GFF file. It AGAT parser removes duplicate features, fixes
    duplicated IDs, adds missing ID and/or Parent attributes, deflates
    factorized attributes (attributes with several parents are duplicated
    with uniq ID), add missing features when possible (e.g. add exon if only
    CDS described, add UTR if CDS and exon described), fix feature locations
    (e.g. check exon is embedded in the parent features mRNA, gene), etc...

    All AGAT's scripts with the _sp_ prefix use the AGAT parser, before to
    perform any supplementary task. So, it is not necessary to run this
    script prior the use of any other _sp_ script.

Usage:
        agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl -g infile.gff [ -o outfile ]
        agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl --help

Options:
    -g, --gtf, --gff or --gxf
            String - Input GTF/GFF file. Compressed file with .gz extension
            is accepted.

    -o or --output
            String - Output GFF file. If no output file is specified, the
            output will be written to STDOUT.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -h or --help
            Boolean - Display this helpful text.
