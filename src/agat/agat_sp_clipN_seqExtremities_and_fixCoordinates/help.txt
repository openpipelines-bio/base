Name:
    agat_sp_clipN_seqExtremities_and_fixCoordinates.pl

Description:
    The script aims to clip the N's extremities of the sequences. The
    annotation from the sequence clipped are modified accrodingly to stay
    consistent

Usage:
        agat_sp_clipN_seqExtremities_and_fixCoordinates.pl -g infile.gff -f infile.fasta  [ -o outfile ]
        agat_sp_clipN_seqExtremities_and_fixCoordinates.pl --help

Options:
    -g, --gff or -ref
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    -f or --fasta
            Input fasta file.

    --of    Output fixed fasta file. If no output file is specified, the
            output will be written to STDOUT.

    --og    Output fixed GFF file. If no output file is specified, the
            output will be written to STDOUT

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    -h or --help
