Name:
    agat_sp_complement_annotations.pl

Description:
    The script allows to complement a reference annotation with other
    annotations. A l1 feature from the addfile.gff that does not overlap a
    l1 feature from the reference annotation will be added. A l1 feature
    from the addfile.gff without a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature with a CDS
    from the reference annotation will be added. A l1 feature from the
    addfile.gff with a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature without a CDS from the
    reference annotation will be added. A l1 feature from the addfile.gff
    with a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature with a CDS from the reference
    annotation will be added only if the CDSs don't overlap. A l1 feature
    from the addfile.gff without a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature without a
    CDS from the reference annotation will be added only if none of the l3
    features overlap. /!\ It is sufficiant that only one isoform is
    overlapping to prevent the whole gene (l1 feature) from the addfile.gff
    to be added in the output.

Usage:
        agat_sp_complement_annotations.pl --ref annotation_ref.gff --add addfile1.gff --add addfile2.gff --out outFile
        agat_sp_complement_annotations.pl --help

Options:
    --ref, -r or -i
            Input GTF/GFF file used as reference.

    --add or -a
            Annotation(s) file you would like to use to complement the
            reference annotation. You can specify as much file you want like
            so: -a addfile1 -a addfile2 -a addfile3 /!\ The order you
            provide these files matter. Once the reference file has been
            complemented by file1, this new annotation becomes the new
            reference that will be complemented by file2 etc. /!\ The result
            with -a addfile1 -a addfile2 will differ to the result from -a
            addfile2 -a addfile1. So, be aware of what you want if you use
            several addfiles.

    --size_min or -s
            Option to keep the non-overlping gene only if the CDS size (in
            nucleotide) is over the minimum size defined. Default = 0 that
            means all of them are kept.

    --out, --output, --outfile or -o
            Output gff3 containing the reference annotation with all the
            non-overlapping newly added genes from addfiles.gff.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

    --help or -h
