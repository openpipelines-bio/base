Name:
    agat_sp_add_start_and_stop.pl.pl

Description:
    The script adds start and stop codons when a CDS feature exists. The
    script looks at the nucleotide sequence and checks the presence of start
    and stop codons. The script works even if the start or stop codon are
    split over several CDS features.

Usage:
        agat_sp_add_start_and_stop.pl.pl --gff infile.gff --fasta genome.fa --out outfile.gff
        agat_sp_add_start_and_stop.pl.pl --help

Options:
    --gff, -i or -g
            Input GTF/GFF file.

    --fasta, --fa or -f
            Input fasta file. Needed to check that CDS sequences start by
            start codon and stop by stop codon.

    --ct, --codon or --table
            Codon table to use. [default 1]

    --out, --output or -o
            Output gff file updated

    -e or --extend
            Boolean - When no start/stop codon found, try to extend the CDS
            to meet the next start/stop codon in the sequence.

    --ni or --na
            Boolean - no iupac / no ambiguous, avoid usage of IUPAC. By
            default IUPAC is used that means, NNN is seen as start and/or
            stop codon.

    -v      Verbose for debugging purpose.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).

     If you're unable to find an (open) issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
     Try as much as possible to include in the issue when relevant:
     - a clear description,
     - as much relevant information as possible,
     - the command used,
     - a data sample,
     - an explanation of the expected behaviour that is not occurring.
